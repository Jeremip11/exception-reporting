## Exception reporting

A simple plugin that reports javascript exceptions to haystack.

For haystack's API see https://github.campfirenow.com/room/460265/paste/1044103238

### TODO

* Figure out how to properly authenticate to haystack
  * I'm not sure how secure the credentials need to be.
* Figure out if we need to provision the atom app ahead of time.
